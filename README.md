# GR-tech-test
The Gilded Rose tech test written in Ruby.
For this task I particularly wanted to push my object-orientation and thinking about code design.

The code to complete this tech test is test-driven (Rspec) and linted with Rubocop.

There is no web interface for this program, however it can be run from the command line. Please run 'bundle install' to install the relevant dependencies.
