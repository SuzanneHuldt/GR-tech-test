# GR-tech-test
The Gilded Rose tech test written in Ruby.
For this task I particularly wanted to push my object-orientation and thinking about code design. As such, I have experimented for the first time with template-method patterning, as a way to deal cleanly with the combination of slight variations, but many shared requirements, between the items in the gilded rose stock. 

The code to complete this tech test is test-driven (Rspec) and linted with Rubocop.

There is no web interface for this program, however it can be run from the command line. Please run 'bundle install' to install the relevant dependencies.
